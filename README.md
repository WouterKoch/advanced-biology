# Advanced Biology
Student repo for the NTNU Advanced Biology course (2021)

The focus of this 2021 PhD course was methods, theory and research relevant to draw joint inference from distributed open and non-open sources of primary biodiversity data, and put this in the context of global change indicators focal to the agenda 2030 sustainability goals. While narrative and structured reviews still are dominating the bulk of biodiversity synthesis, quantitative synthesis from primary data are gaining ground. The advantages in terms of more robust development of prediction models, as well as for directly validating them and testing their generalizability compared to traditional meta-analysis and literature reviews are obvious. Recent progress is made possible by methodological advances in biodiversity-informatics and statistical modelling, but also the open science movement. A useful analogy is individual participant data meta-analyses (IPD-MAs), now considered the gold standard of evidence synthesis in medical research. 


### Git
As part of this course's lectures, we had an intro into git, a tool many biologists are not familiar with. For reference, topics covered there can be found in the [Git and GitHub introduction](Git%20and%20GitHub.md)

### Workshop and output

The code found in this repo is the result of a 3-day workshop to develop project, applying what weâ€™ve learned in this course. The goal we set ourselves was to answer the followin questions:

**Norway will increase its terrestrial protected areas by 12.5% by 2030; can publicly available citizen science data be integrated with survey data & habitat covariates to assess best locations for these new protected areas?**
- How do we make the best use of available data to answer these questions?
- How do we integrating multiple data types (Presence Only, Presence Absence, Remotely Sensed) to be used in Species Distribution Models (SDMs)?.
- Can we generate an open workflow that can be flexible to investigate different criteria of importance?
